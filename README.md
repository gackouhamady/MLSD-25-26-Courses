# MLSD 25–26 — Courses

**Attendance is mandatory, including all PROJECT (PPD) sessions.**  
**Cohort induction:** 29/09/2024 (Rooms: Lavoisier A / Gley)

This repository centralizes notes, resources, and code for all modules in the MLSD program. It mirrors the official timetable (Oct 2024 → Mar 2025 teaching/PPD blocks, defenses in Jun & Sep 2025), and links directly to each UE directory below.

> Times shown are local (Paris): **Morning 09:00–12:30** · **Afternoon 14:00–17:30**.  
> Some days include **extended slots 16:30–18:30** (noted explicitly below).

## How to Use This Repository

1. Each UE folder contains:
   - `README.md` (module syllabus & objectives),  
   - `notes.md` (your synthesized notes),  
   - `resources.md` (papers, videos, libraries),  
   - `notebooks/` or `code/` for exercises and demos.
2. Use commit messages to track learning progress and exam prep.
3. Keep PPD artifacts in `06-PROJET-MLSD/` (plan, deliverables, references).

> **Disclaimer:** This README mirrors the plan you provided. If the school updates rooms, dates, or exam formats, reflect those changes here and in each UE’s `README.md`.
